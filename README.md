# Project Blog

#### By Todd Pangilinan

A react app to document all of my self-directed projects.

## Technologies Used

* React
* TypeScript
* Firebase
* Material UI
* SASS
* NPM
* Vite.js
* HTML
* CSS

## Description:
Post graduation/internship, I started to do some small projects. I decided one good starter project would be to create a personal blog using React. This serves two purposes: 1) it catalogs and allows me to go into depth about the projects I decide to take on. 2) it is in itself a project to help me brush up on React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

The following user stories were considered in planning this app:

* As a user, I want to be able to browse blog postings.
* As a user, I want to be able to read full blog postings.
* As a user, I want to be able to log in and flag suggestions as inappropriate (still working on this feature).
* As an admin user, I want to be able to log in and write a blog post.
* As a admin user, I want to be able to log in and edit/delete a post.

* Via your terminmal, navigate to the directory you want to store my files in.
