Personal notes about project
* 2/1/23:
  * initialized project, got framework started with Vite.js. Just getting warmed up. 
  * Planning on doing a similar front end to what we did with the HaiCue project, but use a Firebase backend (since it is free...and different). Need practice on MUI and TypeScript, so this should be a good practice project.
