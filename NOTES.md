Personal notes about project
* 2/1/23:
  * initialized project, got framework started with Vite.js. Just getting warmed up. 
  * Planning on doing a similar front end to what we did with the HaiCue project, but use a Firebase backend (since it is free...and different). Need practice on MUI and TypeScript, so this should be a good practice project.
* 6/2/23:
  * Ok, it's been four months...I'm rusty. Going to work on getting the first elements of the front end together, and will reconsider DB. Maybe do a full copy of the Haicue project, could use a refersher w/Primsa, Node, and Postgres. Reviewing notes.
